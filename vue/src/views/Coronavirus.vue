          Due to the ongoing Coronavirus situation, to help protect our staff
          and residents we have taken the decision to close the Parish Office to
          the public from Monday 23rd March. Utilising working from home
          procedures where appropriate, and ensuring good hygiene and distancing
          standards we will be able to continue to operate business as usual
          through phone, email and virtual meetings where possible. Post
          delivered to the Parish Office will NOT be picked up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body-2">
          We will continue to provide further updates if anything changes.

          Under the banner 'Food Bank Xtra' the Council is supporting MK Food
          Bank with additional staff and a new, larger distribution centre to
          ensure it has the right resources to cope with the additional demand
          expected during the Coronavirus outbreak. Work is also underway to add
          new collection points to the Food Bankâ€™s network so it can bring the
          food closer to people in need.
